# Bookmarked PDF Export

[简体中文](README.md) | English

Export Obsidian notes to PDFs with native bookmarks generated from Markdown headings.

This plugin turns a note's heading structure into a real PDF outline tree, so PDF readers can show the document outline/bookmarks panel immediately after export. It also keeps the original outline workflow: you can copy or export a note outline as Markdown.

## Primary Workflows

This plugin was built for two main workflows:

- Organizing postgraduate entrance exam syllabi and study materials. Long Markdown notes can be exported as book-like PDFs whose headings become clickable PDF bookmarks, which makes review documents easier to navigate.
- Working together with my note repository, [MBA Study Notes](https://github.com/wendou-chen/MBA-Study-Notes). The notes live and evolve in Obsidian, while this plugin turns selected notes, outlines, and study packs into shareable bookmarked PDFs.

Used together, the note repository provides the structured knowledge base, and this plugin provides a clean export path from Markdown structure to readable PDF documents.

## Features

- Export the current note as `*.bookmarked.pdf`.
- Add bookmarks to a PDF exported by Obsidian's native PDF workflow.
- Generate bookmarks from Markdown headings.
- Open exported PDFs with `/Outlines` and `/PageMode /UseOutlines`.
- Copy or export the current note outline as Markdown.

## Commands

| Command | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| Copy current file outline as Markdown | Copies the note heading tree to the clipboard. |
| Export current file outline as Markdown | Writes a `*.outline.md` file beside the source note. |
| Export bookmarked PDF | Prints the current note to `*.bookmarked.pdf` and injects native PDF bookmarks. |
| Add bookmarks to native PDF | Finds a matching PDF and adds bookmarks based on the source Markdown headings. |

PDF commands are available in the Obsidian desktop app because they depend on Electron PDF export APIs.

## Why This Exists

Obsidian can export notes to PDF, and several community plugins can improve export styling or long-form publishing. The missing piece for study notes, manuals, and book-like documents is reliable native PDF bookmarks generated from the Markdown heading structure.

This plugin focuses on that narrow job: keep writing in Markdown, export to PDF, and preserve the outline as clickable PDF bookmarks.

## Plugin Positioning

| Tool or approach | PDF export | Native PDF bookmarks | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Bookmarked PDF Export (`outline-markdown-export`) | Yes | Yes | Writes `/Outlines` and sets `/PageMode /UseOutlines` with `pdf-lib`. |
| Obsidian core PDF export | Yes | Not reliably from Markdown headings | Useful as a source PDF for the "add bookmarks" command. |
| General outline/TOC plugins | Usually no | Usually no | They often create Markdown outlines or note navigation, not PDF outline objects. |

## Installation From Source

```bash
npm install
npm run build
```

Then copy or keep these files in your vault plugin folder:

```text
.obsidian/plugins/outline-markdown-export/
  main.js
  manifest.json
```

Enable the plugin in Obsidian community plugin settings.

## Development

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
npm test
```

The test suite checks outline parsing, export paths, heading filtering, page mapping, and PDF outline injection.

## Limitations

- PDF export commands require Obsidian desktop.
- Bookmarks are generated from Markdown headings.
- Adding bookmarks to an already exported PDF depends on matching heading text to PDF page text, so scanned/image-only PDFs may not map well.
- The default PDF bookmark filter targets the top heading levels to keep exported outlines readable.
